# Blockademy - ETHSofia 2024

## Overview

Blockademy is a decentralized, blockchain-powered content delivery platform that allows creators to securely share their digital content (videos, images, documents, etc.) with users. It leverages Web3 technologies to ensure user privacy, content ownership, and fair access control by utilizing the iExec Data Protector SDK for secure consumption of digital assets.

Blockademy aims to redefine how users rent, subscribe to, and consume digital content through a fully decentralized and permissionless platform. It is built for ETHSofia2024 and envisions an ecosystem where creators retain full control over their content, and users can rent or subscribe to content seamlessly, ensuring transparency and security in the process.

## Features

- **Decentralized Content Hosting**: All content is stored and delivered using decentralized storage solutions to ensure security, availability, and immutability.
- **iExec Data Protector Integration**: The platform integrates iExec's Data Protector to securely handle access to content while preserving privacy and controlling permissions.
- **Content Rentals and Subscriptions**: Users can rent or subscribe to digital content, ensuring they pay for what they consume and can access content within defined terms.
- **Secure Payment Mechanism**: Blockademy allows payments in cryptocurrency, offering transparent transactions between creators and consumers.
- **Content Access Control**: Only users who have valid subscriptions or rentals can view the content, ensuring that digital assets are protected.
- **Auto-Download & View Capabilities**: After renting or subscribing, users can instantly view or download content based on the permissions set by the creator.
- **Digital Ownership Tracking**: Every piece of content has verifiable ownership recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that creators' rights are fully protected.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: For building the front-end application and managing the content viewer.
- **React Query**: Used for state management and server data synchronization.
- **iExec Data Protector SDK**: For ensuring secure content delivery and privacy protection.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Used to handle interactions with the blockchain, user wallet, and contract deployments.
